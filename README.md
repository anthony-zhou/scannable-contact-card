# Scannable Contact Card

No more awkwardly typing in phone numbers. No more sharing business cards either.

Here's how it works: first, generate a QR code for your contact info. Then, anyone can scan your QR code to add your contact to their address book. 

Unlike other QR-scanning platforms like Snapchat or Wechat, Scannable Contact Card allows you to use your native address book to store contacts, so that your network isn't tied to any specific platform. So you get to own your own digital network and won't be left adrift if <insert big company here> suddenly implodes and loses everything.
